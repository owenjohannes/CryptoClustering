# CryptoClustering

## Description

This repository contains code for clustering cryptocurrencies using the K-means algorithm. 
The project explores two approaches: one using the original scaled data and the other using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature space. 
By comparing the results, we aim to understand the impact of using fewer features on the clustering outcome.
